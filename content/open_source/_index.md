        I believe in the power of open source to drive **innovation**, **collaboration**, and **transparency**. By making my work of research and useful tools publicly available and working on open source projects, I hope to facilitate the exchange of ideas and collaboration and to encourage the sharing of knowledge and expertise within the research and development community, and especially to help advance the state of the art of Natural Language and Machine Learning technologies.

        Check my <a href="https://sites.harvard.edu/jzhou/open-source-softwares/">previous site</a> for a sample of softwares I published pre-LLMs.
