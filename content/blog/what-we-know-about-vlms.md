## What do We Know about Vision-Language Models

Understanding

- Attention Sink

- Logit Lens, e.g. unsupervised segmentation

Efficiency

- Token Pruning/Merging

- Connect to videos

Capabilities

- Visual Task Ablation (different types of images, e.g. from Berkeley work)

- Dense image, ineffectiveness of CLIP encoder vs DINO encoder

- Plantonous Hypothesis
